#In multipage app each time :
when client request to server  :
client request cwh.com ---> server then server send html,css,js-->client
(or client request home section on cwh.com)

#But in case of singlePage App :
when client request to server  :
client request cwh.com ---> server then server send html,css,js-->client
then this same html+css+js uses each time note reloading of full page occur
only required info will change 
(means only some section of page change rest will remains same.
this will reduce server load and increase speed 
so if before 100kb was sent  to client from server then now only 10kb will require)

#We can use bootstrap including cdn links from bootstrap docs
copy paste navbar of bootstrap docs 
if errors show then end the tags with slash(/) if not
