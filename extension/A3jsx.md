JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript 

Note:  
html code in JSX has 2 changes :
1> inPlaceOf class we write  className
2> inPlaceOf for we write  htmlFor 

In function based component we write function  and  return  
then  in return we enclose 
our html code in JSX fragment - <> ..htmlcode... </>
And also enclose in ( ); with semicolon as by default js implements semicolon anywhere
which can destroy our code
