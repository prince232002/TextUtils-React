# reactRouter DOM : it enables you to only change some section of requested item 
not completely load the entire site 

->we use switch then inside route tag which store path of section 
Also we use exact path for proper match of the section we request   
we also give the link and to (in place of a and href ) inside that Navbar-item
section of Navbar 
(eg:  <Link className="nav-link" to="/about">)
we also import link in the app.js
