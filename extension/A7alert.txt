we use alert for our textUtil alert.js
In const(alert, setalert ) = useState(null);
setAlert is function we can pass argument in it  
showAlert is function  (message, type) 
-> then we use setTimeout to hide alert after sometime may be 2 seconds

-> you can use favicon to logo your url tab 
-> you can also show any message on your url tab of browser
like when you toggle dark mode then message 'Enabled darkmode' we have did 
this in the toggle section of darkmode and you can also define setInterval for
it like in every 2 sec it will blink
