Props-
these are arguments passed into React components.
they are passed to components via HTML attributes.
(here in Navbar.js passed from App.js)

Proptypes : it is the type we define for our props if our props argument is not of the type 
then it will produce some error on console of js
defaultProps : it is props argument if we do not pass any argument
isRequired : we use it when passing argument is neccessary like title_name
(you can see syntax in the Navbar.js end code )

Hooks - allows you to use feature of class without declaring class
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
useState : it is a hook allows one to declare a state variable inside a function. It should be noted that one use of useState() can only be used to declare one state variable.
