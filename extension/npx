If the package in issue is only to be used once or twice, rather than every time the project runs, it is preferable to utilize NPX, which will execute the package without installing it. NPM is used to install packages, which we should do if our project requires dependencies or packages.
npx -> is like borrowing anything once while npm is like purchasing something (making yours)
